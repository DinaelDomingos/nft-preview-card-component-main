This is a solution for the NFT preview card component challenge in Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). This is my second challenge and they have helped me a lot to improve my HTML and CSS skills.

I tried to adopt semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties and used Flebox in almost all DIV elements.

My biggest difficulty was with the overlay effect for DIV ,image . I didn't remember how to apply the effect and it was necessary to research other ready-made solutions to be able to deliver the final project. But in the end it was a great learning experience.

Please feel free for any comments and feedback.
